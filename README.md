**Your Tale**- A Terraria mod thing I make when I'm bored.
Check my profile for more stuff.
This might be broken sometimes so i would get this from the official Tmod site so you can update it a lot easier, untill version 1.5 official release it will not work a lot.
## Things we currently have:
1. 2 New armour sets with unique buffs
2. 6 new enemies
3. 28 new items
4. a unique starting point where you mine for flint first and then make flint tools 


## Things we are adding:
1. Hardmode stuff
2. nerfing many overpowered weapons and tools.
3. making enemy AI better, and adding in almost OP mobs.
4. every time you die NPCs have a chance to higher their prices
5. and other basic mod stuff like more weapons, bosses, etc.
