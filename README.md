**Your Tale**- A Terraria mod thing I make when I'm bored.
Check my profile for more stuff.
This might be broken sometimes so i would get this from the official Tmod site so you can update it a lot easier, untill version 1.5 official release it will not work a lot.
## Things we currently have:
1. Flint and Cryolite Armor and tools.
2. Some basic mobs, listed below:

A Tsuchinoko, a mythical lizard-like creature that burrows undergound...

A ZombKing, that is much stronger than a normal zombie that drops better loot and is much more of a challenge!

A Prince Slime, that spawns on the outer regions of the map and deals incredible damage, has insane defense, but can drop a king slime spawner.
3. inability to mine wood and stone with the basic copper picks, forcing you to collect flint from rocks to make flint tools and armour.
3. Adding banners for said mobs soon enough.
4. Adding buffs and arrow types as I type here.
## Things we are adding:
1. Hardmode stuff
2. nerfing many overpowered weapons and tools.
3. making enemy AI better, and adding in almost OP mobs.
4. every time you die NPCs have a chance to higher their prices
5. and other basic mod stuff like more weapons, bosses, etc.
