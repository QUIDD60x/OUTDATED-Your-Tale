Hello and welcome to YourTale! Yourtale (Your Tale, yourtale) is a modded experience for Terraria's modloader, meant to be tinkered with by others and myself.
All of the source code is completely open, and totally open for share. All I ask in return is a simple "Thanks" in the description or the code itself.

Make sure to hit me up on Discord (Quidd#7638) and tell me about what you're making, I'd love to hear about it! Or if you have any comments, credits, or suggestions i'm open for that aswell.

I hope you enjoy this code, as no matter what level of skill you are I've tried to include something helpful.
This is open release 1.0, a pretty barebones mod structure i've been working on as a hobby project for a couple months, I'll be updating it regularly though so check back weekly!
-------------------------------------------
This currently includes:
-Custom world generation, currently supports ore generation and will soon support custom structures and loot placement.
-A couple weapon types, such as lots of different staffs and whatnot.
-a couple custom mobs and 1 boss, all with varying AIs to mess around with.
-Custom prefixes, obtainable in normal play.
-LOTS of custom projectiles.
And of course weekly/bi-weekly updates to improve the code and add new custom things!

Check the github for more info, and to get notified upon a new release! (https://github.com/QUIDD60x/Your-Tale)

This mod is not really meant to be played normally, as there are probably unbalanced features and not a lot of time worth playing with.

Lots of love to:
Tmodloader, and their example mod for helping me grasp the basics of modding terraria.
FoolsLynx, for getting me intrested in this whole mess.
The DRGN mod developer/s for providing an open sourced mod with lots of neat content aswell, that really helped me through harder coding times.
And you, for reading this much!

I hope you can enjoy this mod as much as I enjoyed coding it. -Quidd
