This mod is basically RLCraft for Terraria. Ever played RLCraft? No?? Good.
You can find more info about the mod and what to do on the homepage button below.
This mod is best enjoyed on medium character difficulty, small world, non-expert world.
Currently in hardcore development, if you're reading this then it should always work then.
Quick download questions (what we have and if it's good for you)
We are currently working on prehardmode, and we move up adding stuff slowly. As of update 1.5 we are on skeletron, there is NO new stuff past that point.
we like to make the game hard for a challenging experience.
We currently have:
1. Flint tools and armour
2.inability to mine with copper tools, forcing to take the long route and use flint.
3.small custom generated ores, and a lot of prehardmode stuff.
custom boss soon maybe? (still being worked on...)
What we plan on adding soon:
1. bring the expert mode AI into any difficulty.
